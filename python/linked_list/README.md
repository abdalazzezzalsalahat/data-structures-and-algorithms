# Linked List
*It was a good one*

## Challenge Description
*write a node class to create a node for singly linked list with pointer to the next node, and another class called linked_list that have functions to initialize a node, append nodes, insert a new node, search nodes.*

## Approach & Efficiency
1. *Create a class that creats a node with a next pointer property.*
2. *Create a class called linked_list that contains five methods.*
3. *Create an initialization method to set the head node.*
4. *Create a method to append a value in the last node.*
5. *Create a method to represent a class object as a string.*
6. *Create a method to add an node to the list.*
7. *Create a method to check if an element if exists in the list and returns a boolean (True/Flase).*
8. *Checked for any bugs/errors using unit testing.*
9. *Worked perfictly.*

# Singly Linked List Insertions

> The linked list is alternative to an array-based structure. A linked list is collection of nodes that collectively form linear sequence. In a singly linked list, each node stores a reference to an object that is an element of the sequence, as well as a reference to the next node of the list. It does not store any pointer or reference to the previous node. To store a single linked list, only the reference or pointer to the first node in that list must be stored. The last node in a single linked list points to nothing.

## Challenge

1. Create a Node class that has properties for the value stored in the Node, and a pointer to the next Node. Within your LinkedList class, include a head property. Upon instantiation, an empty Linked List should be created. 

2. Create methods in the LinkedList class : 

3. append(value) which adds a new node with the given value to the end of the list

4. insertBefore(value, newVal) which add a new node with the given newValue immediately before the first value 

5. insertAfter(value, newVal) which add a new node with the given newValue immediately after the first value node

## Approach & Efficiency

* `space <- O(1)`
* `time  <- O(n)`

## API

> `append(value)` function  : which adds a new node with the given value to the end of the list

> `insertBefore(value, newVal)` function :  which add a new node with the given newValue immediately before the first value 

> `insertAfter(value, newVal)` function :  which add a new node with the given newValue immediately after the first value node
