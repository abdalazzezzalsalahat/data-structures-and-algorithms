# Linked List
*It was a good one*

## Challenge Description
*write a node class to create a node for singly linked list with pointer to the next node, and another class called linked_list that have functions to initialize a node, append nodes, insert a new node, search nodes.*

## Approach & Efficiency
1. *Create a class that creats a node with a next pointer property.*
2. *Create a class called linked_list that contains five methods.*
3. *Create an initialization method to set the head node.*
4. *Create a method to append a value in the last node.*
5. *Create a method to represent a class object as a string.*
6. *Create a method to add an node to the list.*
7. *Create a method to check if an element if exists in the list and returns a boolean (True/Flase).*
8. *Checked for any bugs/errors using unit testing.*
9. *Worked perfictly.*
