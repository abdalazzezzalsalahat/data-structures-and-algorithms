# Trees
> * *Binary Trees and Binary Search Trees are a data structure often used in software. A Binary Tree or Binary Search Tree is an example of what a file system may look like. For balanced Binary Search Trees search time is O(log n).*

## Challenge

> * *Write instance methods of a Binary Tree pre-order, in-order and post-order which show a list of the tree values in these traversal orders. Write instance methods of a Binary Search Tree add and contains which update and read a Binary Search Tree for a value in time O(log n).*

## Approach & Efficiency

> * *API methods of instances of a Binary Tree and a Binary Search Tree pre-order, in-order and post-order take Big O time O(n) and space O(1). The API method of instances of a Binary Search Tree add and contains take Big O time O(log n) and space O(1).*

## API 

> * *The API instance methods for a Binary Tree and Binary Search Tree are pre-order, in-order and post-order. The API instance methods for a Binary Search Tree are add and contains.* 



# Code Challenge 16 - Find Max Binary Tree Value

* Find the Maximum Value in a Binary Tree

## TESTS

* test_return_max_single_node - Test that binary tree with single item returns correct value.

* test_return_maxVal_of_all - Test that binary tree with many nodes returns correct value.

* test_max_of_none - If tree.root is None return None.

## Challenge
* Write an instance method called find-maximum-value. Return the maximum value stored in the tree. You can assume that the values stored in the Binary Tree will be numeric.


## Big O notation

* time <- O(n)
* space <- O(n)

# Code Challenge 17 - Breadth First

* Write a breadth first traversal method which takes a Binary Tree as its unique input. Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available, traverse the input tree using a Breadth-first approach, and return a list of the values in the tree in the order they were encountered.

## Tests

* test_empty_tree - If tree is empty return None.
* test_single_node - Test that binary tree with single item returns list with that single item.
* test_four_nodes - Test that binary tree with four nodes returns list with those four items.
* test_many_nodes - Test that binary tree with 10 nodes returns list with those 10 items.

## Challenge

* Write a function called breadth_first which takes a tree as input. Traverse the input tree using a Breadth-first approach, and return a list of the values in the tree in the order they were encountered.

## Big O notation

* time <- O(n)
* space <- O(n)
