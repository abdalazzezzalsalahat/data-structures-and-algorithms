## Code challenge 13 : Multi Bracket Validation
* *The function should take a string as its only argument, and should return a boolean representing whether or not the brackets in the string are balanced. There are 3 types of brackets: `{} [] ()`*

* *Given a string containing just the characters **'(', ')', '{', '}', '[' and ']'**, determine if the input string is valid.*

* *Open brackets must be closed by the same type of brackets. Open brackets must be closed in the correct order. Note that an empty string is also considered valid.*

## Challenge
